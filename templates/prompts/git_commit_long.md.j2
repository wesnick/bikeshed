Please write a git commit message following these guidelines:

1. Start with a clear, concise summary line (50-72 characters)
2. Use semantic commit messages (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, etc)

If the commit is large, ie, greater than 1000 lines, in addition to the summary, do the following:

1. Add a blank line after the summary
2. Include brief details about what changed and why
3. Mention important component changes
4. Keep the message informative but concise

Return ONLY the commit message, nothing else.  Exclude editorial commentary.  Do not use code fences.

This is the commit diff:

<commit_diff>
{{ git_diff }}
</commit_diff>
